    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>500 g / 1 lb peeled shrimp/prawns (Note 1)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>50 g / 3.5 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>3 tbsp / 30g flour, plain / all purpose</li>
        <li>2 cups / 500ml milk, preferably warmed (Note 2)</li>
        <li>2.5 cups hot tap water</li>
        <li>250 g / 8 oz elbow macaroni, uncooked (2.5 cups)</li>
        <li>1.5 cups (150g) cheese (Cheddar, gruyere, or other), freshly grated (Note 3)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (75g) mozzarella cheese, freshly grated (Note 3)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mustard powder</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parmesan Breadcrumb Topping:</strong></li>
        <li>1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat broiler/grill on high.</li>
        <li>Mix together Breadcrumb Topping.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and melt 1 tbsp butter in a large, deep skillet or heatproof pot on the stove over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp, sprinkle with pepper, then cook for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for another minute until the
            shrimp has changed color but not fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Transfer shrimp to a bowl. Turn heat down to medium.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining butter. Add flour and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour milk in slowly, stirring as you go. Once incorporated and lump-free (use a whisk if needed), stir in
            Seasonings, then water.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid is hot, add macaroni. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring regularly, until macaroni is almost
            cooked through, then take it off the stove.</li>
        <li>Add cheeses and stir through, then add shrimp. Taste for salt and tweak if needed. It should be saucy (see
            video) - it gets absorbed. Should still be saucy at this stage - sauce gets absorbed/thickens more in the
            next step.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over breadcrumbs, then place under the hot grill for just 2 - 3 minutes until the top is golden.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley if desired and serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>


    <p>Enjoy you meal!</p>
